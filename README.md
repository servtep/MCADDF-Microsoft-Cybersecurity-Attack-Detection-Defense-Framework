## 📖 Overview

The **Microsoft Cybersecurity Attack, Detection & Defense Framework** is a holistic repository designed to bridge the critical gap between traditional on-premises security and modern cloud-native defense.

Unlike standard checklists, this framework maps the entire adversarial lifecycle across the **Hybrid Microsoft Ecosystem**—from **Active Directory** to **Entra ID (Azure AD)**, **Azure Resources**, and **Microsoft 365**. It provides a unified language for Red and Blue Teams to simulate, detect, and mitigate advanced threats.

## 🛡️ Core Philosophy

Modern enterprises do not operate in silos; they operate in hybrid states. Attackers pivot seamlessly between on-prem domain controllers and cloud tenants. This framework is built to reflect that reality.

### Key Features
*   **Hybrid-Native Focus:** Deeply analyzes the synchronization points (e.g., Azure AD Connect) where most modern breaches occur.
*   **The SERVTEP ID System:** Utilizes a proprietary navigation system for precise referencing and tracking.
*   **MITRE ATT&CK® v18.1 Aligned:** Every technique is mapped to the latest T-codes, ensuring compatibility with standard threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Purple Team Ready:** Each entry is designed to support both **Offensive Execution** (Red) and **Defensive Detection** (Blue).

## 🏗️ Defense Scope

This framework goes beyond simple remediation. Every technique analyzes defense across four critical architectural layers:

| Layer | Scope of Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Identity & Access** | **RBAC/ABAC** models, **Conditional Access** policies, **PIM** (Privileged Identity Management), and **Tiered Admin** models. |
| **Network Security** | **NSG** (Network Security Groups), **Azure Firewall**, **Private Links**, and **Segmentation** strategies. |
| **Data Governance** | **Azure Purview** labeling, **DLP** (Data Loss Prevention) policies, and **Information Protection** controls. |
| **Monitoring** | **Microsoft Sentinel** (KQL), **Splunk** (SPL), **Sysmon** (XML), and **Unified Audit Logs**. |

## 🧩 The SERVTEP ID System

To simplify navigation across 500+ techniques, we have developed a proprietary logical identifier system. This allows practitioners to instantly recognize the **Tactic**, **Target Technology**, and **Specific Vector** just by reading the ID.

### ID Format Structure
The ID follows the syntax: `[TACTIC]-[TECHNOLOGY]-[INDEX]`

> **Example:** `REC-AD-001`
> *   **REC**: Tactic Category (**Reconnaissance**)
> *   **AD**: Target Technology (**Active Directory**)
> *   **001**: Unique Identifier

### Technology Identifiers (Middle Code)
These codes define the specific environment or technology stack targeted by the technique.

| Code | Target Environment | Scope & Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AD** | Active Directory (On-Prem) | Domain Controllers, LDAP, Kerberos, DNS, GPO, LAPS |
| **CLOUD** | Azure & Entra ID | App Registrations, Service Principals, Key Vaults, Azure Resources |
| **M365** | Microsoft 365 SaaS | Exchange Online, SharePoint, Teams, Graph API, OneDrive |
| **HYBRID** | Sync Architecture | Azure AD Connect, PHS, PTA, Federation (ADFS), Seamless SSO |
| **PHISH** | Social Engineering | OAuth Consent Grants, Device Code Phishing, Branding Spoofing |
| **EXPLOIT**| Vulnerability Exploitation | CVEs, Deserialization, Logic Apps, Unpatched Services |
| **CERT** | Certificate Services | ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services), ESC1-ESC8, CA Misconfigs |
| **CONTAINER**| Cloud Native | Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Kubelet API, Docker, Pod Escape |
| **SQL** | Database Services | Azure SQL, MSSQL, Data Exfiltration, SQL Injection |
| **ENDO** | Endpoint / OS | Windows 10/11, Server OS, Local Security Authority (LSA) |

## 💡 How to Use This Framework

### For Red Teams
Use this repository as a comprehensive "cheat sheet" for campaign planning. The **SERVTEP IDs** allow you to chain techniques logically (e.g., `REC-AD-001` → `CA-DUMP-002` → `LM-HYBRID-003`) to simulate realistic APT behaviors.

### For Blue Teams & Detection Engineers
Use the framework for **Gap Analysis**. Select a technique ID (e.g., `IA-PHISH-002`), simulate it, and verify if your SIEM/EDR triggers the expected alert.

### For Architects & CISOs
Utilize the index to audit your environment's exposure. Prioritize remediation based on the "Technique Severity" and prevalence noted in the documentation.
